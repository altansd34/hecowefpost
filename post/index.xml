Before that, people relied on&amp;nbsp;good-old soap, made of&amp;nbsp;different natural cleansers. Unfortunately, soap doesn’t work well in&amp;nbsp;the mineral-heavy water that we&amp;nbsp;use. Yet, shampoo has a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;weighty disadvantages that often make&amp;nbsp;us look for better options.
Bright Side advocates for a&amp;nbsp;healthier lifestyle and believes we&amp;nbsp;can improve our daily life with little changes, like switching from shampoo to&amp;nbsp;its alternatives. Read about why we&amp;nbsp;should make this switch in&amp;nbsp;the bonus at&amp;nbsp;the end of&amp;nbsp;the article.</description></item><item><title>11 Subtle Gestures That Can Reveal a Person Is Insecure Right Away</title><link>/11-subtle-gestures-that-can-reveal-a-person-is-insecure-right-away-799407.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/11-subtle-gestures-that-can-reveal-a-person-is-insecure-right-away-799407.html</guid><description>People don’t like to&amp;nbsp;show their weaknesses, so&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;difficult moments, we&amp;nbsp;try to&amp;nbsp;hide our insecurities and show others that we&amp;nbsp;are in&amp;nbsp;control of&amp;nbsp;the situation and that we&amp;nbsp;feel comfortable.

It’s one thing when a&amp;nbsp;movie propagandizes something openly and you see it&amp;nbsp;instantly, but it’s a&amp;nbsp;totally different story when a&amp;nbsp;flick subtly and unnoticeably plants certain ideas, which are not always nice and pleasant, in&amp;nbsp;the heads of&amp;nbsp;its viewers. Things get even more serious if&amp;nbsp;the movie is&amp;nbsp;watched by&amp;nbsp;kids or&amp;nbsp;teenagers.

Swelling is&amp;nbsp;the first consequence and that’s why damaged bleached hair looks so&amp;nbsp;voluminous. Also, the lack of&amp;nbsp;melanin makes your hair look colorless and it&amp;nbsp;changes to&amp;nbsp;reddish or&amp;nbsp;yellowish tones based on&amp;nbsp;what color the hair dye was.
Bright Side found 11&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the most effective ways to&amp;nbsp;repair damaged hair that can be&amp;nbsp;done by&amp;nbsp;either a&amp;nbsp;professional hairdresser or&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;yourself at&amp;nbsp;home.</description></item><item><title>16 social media slang terms you need to know</title><link>/social-media-slang-terms.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/social-media-slang-terms.html</guid><description>“BTW IDK when ur free.

Being in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;couple offers a&amp;nbsp;sense of&amp;nbsp;comfort, and because of&amp;nbsp;this, other relationships may get neglected.

Ir is the Spanish verb meaning “to go.” A means “to.” Add an unconjugated verb in the infinitive and you have a phrase in the near future tense in Spanish: ir a hablar (going to talk). Conjugate the verb ir and you have a complete sentence: Voy a hablar (I am going to talk).
This structure is extremely useful because ir is the verb we use to talk about anything that will happen soon.</description></item><item><title>What 13 Stars of The Hunger Games Look Like 10 Years After Its Premiere</title><link>/what-13-stars-of-the-hunger-games-look-like-10-years-after-its-premiere-806967.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/what-13-stars-of-the-hunger-games-look-like-10-years-after-its-premiere-806967.html</guid><description>In&amp;nbsp;2012, The Hunger Games hit the big screen to&amp;nbsp;delight&amp;nbsp;us with the first installment of&amp;nbsp;Katniss Everdeen’s adventures.

Fashion and wardrobe are essential when creating a&amp;nbsp;character. For example, think about the first thing you&amp;nbsp;do, for instance, on&amp;nbsp;Halloween, when you want to&amp;nbsp;look like a&amp;nbsp;famous character. Before even thinking about wearing a&amp;nbsp;mask, you actually figure out how to&amp;nbsp;dress up&amp;nbsp;like that character!
So&amp;nbsp;taking that into account, Bright Side thought it&amp;nbsp;could be&amp;nbsp;fun to&amp;nbsp;conduct a&amp;nbsp;little test to&amp;nbsp;see how sharp your visual memory&amp;nbsp;is.</description></item><item><title>The Subjunctive Tense in Spanish | Lingoda</title><link>/when-to-use-subjunctive-tense-in-spanish.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/when-to-use-subjunctive-tense-in-spanish.html</guid><description>No more headaches: When to use the subjunctive tense in Spanish The subjunctive in Spanish used to give me headaches.

Even science confirms that smiling guys attract women less. But it’s time to&amp;nbsp;find out why this happens.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side got curious about why a&amp;nbsp;man who smiles less on&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;date has more chances among women, and we’d like to&amp;nbsp;share some conclusions that researchers have made.

A&amp;nbsp;bride who designed a ‘modest’ wedding dress claimed there’s nothing ‘uglier’ than an&amp;nbsp;immodest bride.
amen to that!
Weddings often stir up&amp;nbsp;varying opinions, influenced by&amp;nbsp;family dynamics and societal expectations. However, there is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;general consensus that a&amp;nbsp;bride should be&amp;nbsp;celebrated on&amp;nbsp;her special day, with one exception being a&amp;nbsp;woman who received criticism for insisting brides should adhere to&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;specific dress code.</description></item></channel></rss>
