INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p><p>(a) <strong><u>By </u></strong><strong><u>Morning Consult</u></strong>. Morning Consult will defend, indemnify, and hold Customer and its employees, agents, officers, directors, successors, and assigns (the “<u>Customer Indemnitees</u>”) harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses (together, the “<u>Losses</u>”), arising from any claim, suit or action (each, a “<u>Claim</u>”) brought against any such Customer Indemnitee by a third party to the extent such Claim arises from an allegation that any Product, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the valid United States copyright or patent of such third party. However, Morning Consult will not be obligated to defend, indemnify, or hold any Customer Indemnitee harmless from any Claim unless Customer (x) notifies Morning Consult in writing of any actual or threatened Claim within ten (10) days after it learns of such a Claim, (y) grants Morning Consult sole control of the defense and settlement thereof, and (z) provides Morning Consult all reasonable assistance in connection therewith. If any of the Products is finally held to so infringe, or in Morning Consult’s sole reasonable judgment is likely to be so held, Morning Consult will, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the applicable Product, (ii) modify or replace the applicable Product to make it non-infringing as long as such Product, as modified or replaced, has the same functionality in all material respects, or (iii) terminate the applicable Order Form (as applicable to the infringing Product only) and provide Customer a pro rata refund of any pre-paid fees applicable to such Product for the period after termination. Notwithstanding the above, Morning Consult will have no obligations under this Section 7(a) or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim arising out of: (A) use of other than a current, unaltered Release of the Products unless the infringing portion is also in the then current Release, (B) any use of the Products in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available hereunder by Morning Consult if the infringement was caused by such use or combination, (C) any use, modification, or derivation of the Products not specifically authorized in writing by Morning Consult or expressly permitted under this Agreement, or (D) a Customer Party’s negligence or willful misconduct (including the negligence or willful misconduct of any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party). <strong>THE FOREGOING STATES MORNING CONSULT’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ALL THIRD PARTY CLAIMS</strong>.</p><p>(b) <strong><u>By Customer</u></strong>. Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold Morning Consult, its licensors, and each such party’s parent, Affiliates, employees, agents, representatives, officers, directors, successors, and assigns (the “<u>MC Indemnitees</u>”) harmless from and against any and all Losses arising from any Claim brought against any such MC Indemnitee by a third party to the extent such Claim arises from or relates to (i) a Customer Party’s negligence or willful misconduct (including the negligence or willful misconduct of any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party), or breach of any of Customer’s representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) a Customer Party’s use of the Services, Licensed Data, and/or Web Content (including use of the same by any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party), or (iii) an allegation that (x) Customer does not have the right to provide the Customer Data to Morning Consult as contemplated by this Agreement or to use the Customer Data in connection with the Services, (y) a Customer Party (or any person acting on behalf of a Customer Party) uses the Services in violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or (z) Morning Consult is liable or responsible for any use of the Customer Data provided that such use by Morning Consult is in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Customer shall assume, at its sole cost and expense, the defense of such Claims through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Morning Consult, except that Morning Consult may at its option and expense select and be represented by separate counsel. Morning Consult shall reasonably cooperate with Customer, at Customer’s request and sole expense, in defending any such Claim; provided, however, that Customer will not, without the prior written consent of Morning Consult, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (A) provides for any admission of liability on the part of any of the MC Indemnitees, or relief other than the payment of monetary damages for which the Customer will be solely liable, (B) adversely affects the rights of Morning Consult under this Agreement, or (C) does not fully release the MC Indemnitees from all liability in respect thereof. In no event shall the MC Indemnitees be liable for any Claims that are disposed of, compromised, or settled in violation of this Section. If Customer fails to assume the defense of any actual or threatened Claim covered by this Section within the earlier of (y) any deadline established in a written demand by a court or (z) thirty (30) calendar days of Customer’s receipt of notice of such Claim, Morning Consult may follow such course of action as it reasonably deems necessary to protect its interests, and shall be indemnified by Customer for all costs reasonably incurred in such action, including without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses.</p><p><strong><u>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</u>.</strong> <strong>SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION, WE DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE SERVICES UNLESS DUE SOLELY TO MORNING CONSULT’S INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING. </strong><strong>IN NO EVENT, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, SHALL ANY MC INDEMNITEE BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF USE, VALUE, PROFIT, REVENUE, OR GOODWILL, OR OTHER INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THIRD PARTY MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER (A) SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF ANY PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES OR (B) ANY REMEDY HEREUNDER FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE MC INDEMNITEES ARISING OUT OF ANY CLAIM OR CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE SUM OF THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO MORNING CONSULT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY, DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH SUCH CLAIM OR CLAIMS AROSE. YOUR RIGHT TO MONETARY DAMAGES IN THAT AMOUNT SHALL BE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER REMEDIES WHICH YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST ANY MC INDEMNITEE. ALL CLAIMS THAT CUSTOMER MAY HAVE AGAINST MORNING CONSULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE AGGREGATED TO SATISFY THE LIMIT SET FORTH HEREUNDER AND MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT.</strong></p><p><strong>9. TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong></p><p>(a) <strong><u>Term</u></strong>. This Agreement is effective on the Effective Date and will continue for the term specified in the applicable Order Form, including any renewal terms entered into thereunder, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively, the “<u>Term</u>”).</p><p>(b) <strong><u>Termination By Customer</u></strong>. Customer may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice if Morning Consult breaches a material term of this Agreement and fails to cure the same within such 30-day period.</p><p>(c) <strong><u>Termination By Morning Consult</u></strong>. Morning Consult may, without limiting any other right or remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law, or in equity, immediately suspend any Customer Party’s access to and use of the Products (including, for the avoidance of doubt, delivery of Economic Intelligence Data via CSV as may be contemplated in an Order Form), and/or immediately terminate this Agreement if Morning Consult reasonably determines, in its sole discretion, that any Customer Party has breached any provision of this Agreement. You will continue to be charged for all fees during any period of suspension under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Morning Consult may, for any reason, immediately suspend or terminate any Customer Party’s access to and use of any Service that has been granted on a free or trial basis.</p><p>(d) <strong><u>Automatic Termination</u></strong>. This Agreement will terminate with immediate effect if Customer becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p><p>(e) <strong><u>Effect of Termination</u></strong>.</p><p>(i) The Services will terminate immediately upon any termination of the Agreement, and each Customer Party will immediately cease all use of such Services.</p><p>(ii) Morning Consult will have no obligation to refund any amounts paid by Customer under this Agreement upon termination. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Customer will pay Morning Consult all amounts relating to any outstanding invoices, including any reimbursable expenses incurred prior to such termination or expiration. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than under Section 9(b), and without limiting any other right or remedy available to Morning Consult under this Agreement, at law, or in equity, Customer will pay Morning Consult one hundred percent (100%) of the remaining balance of the total fees for Services that would have been payable by Customer for the balance of the applicable Term (as if this Agreement had not been terminated) and any additional amounts to which Morning Consult is entitled pursuant to applicable law.</p><p>(iii) Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement and all outstanding Order Forms, each party shall promptly destroy all copies of such other party’s Confidential Information in such party’s possession or control, and in circumstances where Customer elects to destroy such copies of Morning Consult’s Confidential Information, Customer shall promptly confirm destruction of the same in writing to Morning Consult. Notwithstanding the above, Morning Consult may (x) set an earlier time after which it is no longer obligated to retain certain Customer Data, and (y) retain all Work Product in the Products for up to twenty-four (24) months after the expiration or termination of this Agreement and the last outstanding Order Form unless Customer requests earlier deletion in writing to Morning Consult. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Morning Consult may retain a copy of Customer Confidential Information (A) in such manner and for such period of time as is required by applicable law, rule or regulation (including the valid order of a court or regulatory authority, or when necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims) and (B) in its backup and disaster recovery systems until they are destroyed in the ordinary course of business; provided that, in each case, any Customer Confidential Information so retained shall, notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, be kept confidential in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until it is destroyed.</p><p>(f) <strong><u>Suspension of Services</u></strong>. Morning Consult may immediately suspend the Customer Parties’ access to the Products at any time if Morning Consult has reasonable, good-faith concerns about a security threat that could affect the Products or the data of any other user of the Products. Morning Consult may immediately terminate the Services if a Customer Party (i) commits any criminal act or other act involving moral turpitude or felonious activities, (ii) commits any act or becomes involved in any situation or occurrence which brings Customer into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule, or which Morning Consult reasonably determines reflects unfavorably upon Morning Consult or (iii) makes or authorizes statements in derogation of Morning Consult or its Services and such statements become public during the Term.</p><p><strong>10. PRODUCT SUPPORT; SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT. </strong>Morning Consult will provide feature and availability support for the Products in accordance with the procedures set forth in Exhibit B hereto, and the Products are subject to the uptime service level agreement set forth in Exhibit A hereto. Any other support for Services, if any, and applicable pricing, will be specified in the Order Form.</p><p><strong>11. GENERAL.</strong></p><p>(a) <strong><u>Notices</u></strong>. Any notice required or permitted hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given (i) upon hand delivery, (ii) on the third day following delivery to the U.S. Postal Service as certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, (iii) on the first day following delivery to a recognized overnight courier service, fee prepaid and return receipt or other confirmation of delivery requested, or (iv) on the date of dispatch of an e-mail sent to the e-mail address of such party (or on the following business day if sent after the recipient’s normal business hours). Any such notice will be delivered or sent to a party at its physical address or e-mail address (in the case of Customer, as set forth in the “Customer Information” section of the applicable Order Form (and in the absence of an Order Form, to Customer’s last known place of business or e-mail address), and in the case of Morning Consult, to 1025 F Street NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20004 (Attn: Legal)) or to such other physical address, e-mail address, or facsimile number as may be designated by a party hereto in a notice given to the other from time to time in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the above, in order for any notice to Morning Consult to be effective hereunder, such notice must also be sent to <a href=#>notice@morningconsult.com</a>.</p><p>(b) <strong><u>Governing Law</u></strong>. This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. The parties agree that any litigation pertaining to this Agreement shall be heard exclusively in courts located in the State of Delaware, and the parties hereby waive any objections based upon the jurisdiction, forum, or venue of such courts.</p><p>(c) <strong><u>Arbitration</u></strong>. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be handled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be Washington, DC. Either party may apply to the arbitrator(s) for purposes of seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal’s determination of the merits of the controversy). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to Customer’s obligation to pay any amounts or costs due under this Agreement shall be excluded from this Section 11(c). <strong>THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. </strong><strong>Further, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer agrees that no class or collective actions can be asserted in arbitration or otherwise. All claims, whether in arbitration or otherwise, must be brought solely in the Customer’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or collective proceeding.</strong></p><p>(d) <strong><u>Injunctive Relief</u></strong>. Recognizing and acknowledging that any breach by a Customer Party of the provisions of this Agreement may cause Morning Consult irreparable damage for which monetary damages may be inadequate, Customer agrees that, in addition to monetary damages and any other remedies available to Morning Consult at law or in equity, Morning Consult will have the right to petition for injunctive or such other equitable relief as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such a breach or threatened breach without (i) having to prove actual damages or (ii) the requirement of a bond or notice, and Customer agrees not to object or defend against any such action on any basis, including on the basis that monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy.</p><p>(e) <strong><u>Assignment</u></strong>. Neither party will assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Morning Consult may assign this Agreement without such consent to its successor in interest by way of merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees, and attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Agreement will be null, void, and invalid.</p><p>(f) <strong><u>Severability</u></strong>. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.</p><p>(g) <strong><u>Force Majeure</u></strong>. Neither party will be liable for any costs, expenses, or damages due to nonperformance under this Agreement arising out of any cause not within the reasonable control of such party and without its fault or negligence, including but not limited to acts of God, riots or civil commotions, supplier problems, war, terrorism, or other acts of any nation or governmental agency or authority. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement that directly results from any delay or failure of the other party to perform its obligations as set forth in this Agreement.</p><p>(h) <strong><u>Waiver</u></strong>. No waiver of a breach of any term of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and duly executed by the waiving party. No such waiver will constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term of this Agreement. No failure on the part of a party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any of its rights hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise by a party of any right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. No course of dealing between the parties will be deemed effective to modify, amend, or discharge any part of this Agreement or the rights or obligations of any party hereunder.</p><p>(i) <strong><u>Entire Agreement</u></strong>. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and supersedes any prior agreements, proposals, or representations, written or oral, or other understandings among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no representations, warranties, covenants, or obligations of any party not expressly contained herein. The terms and conditions contained in any purchase orders, correspondence, or other documents forming part of any Customer order for Services, even if signed or otherwise acknowledged by an employee or agent of Morning Consult, will be deemed to be null and void and of no force and effect.</p><p>(j) <strong><u>Litigation Support</u></strong>. In the event Customer purchases Professional Services with the intent or for the purpose of using such Services in connection with ongoing or threatened litigation, Customer shall promptly disclose such intent or purpose in writing to Morning Consult prior to entering into the applicable Order Form. In the event Morning Consult provides Professional Services that are used by Customer in connection with ongoing or threatened litigation, or any MC Indemnitee is served with or becomes subject to any legal process in connection therewith, including but not limited to a subpoena, order, deposition, interrogatory, or investigative demand (each, a “<u>Legal Order</u>“) in any legal, administrative, or governmental proceeding to which Morning Consult is not a party, Customer shall compensate or reimburse each such MC Indemnitee (or Morning Consult on such MC Indemnitee’s behalf if Morning Consult incurs such costs directly) for any and all reasonable and documented actual out-of-pocket-costs, including without limitation, document production and copying costs, attorneys’ fees and expenses, filing fees, and travel expenses incurred in connection with responding to and/or complying with such Legal Order, except to the extent such Legal Order arises out of or is caused by Morning Consult’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement.</p><p>(k) <strong><u>Construction</u></strong>. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only. They do not constitute a portion of this Agreement and will not be used in any construction thereof. Any interpretation of this Agreement will not presume that its terms should be more strictly construed against one party by reason of any rule of construction or authorship. Further, any Order Form entered into between the parties may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, and delivery of an executed counterpart signature page by facsimile or e-mail is as effective as executing and delivering an Order Form in the presence of the other party to this Agreement. Any signatures on an Order Form that are electronic or that are delivered electronically will be deemed effective for all purposes and will be deemed originals.</p><p>(l) <strong><u>Publicity</u></strong>. Morning Consult shall be permitted to use the name and logo of Customer in its customer lists and promotional materials with Customer’s consent only. Neither party may make any public announcement or disclosure of any Claim, defense, or settlement hereunder without the other party’s prior written approval. No Customer Party shall use the MC Marks for the making of a case study, testimonial, press release, or other public announcement regarding this Agreement or any activities performed for or on behalf of any Customer Party without Morning Consult’s prior written approval in each instance. The MC Marks may be used and displayed only in the form approved by Morning Consult in writing.</p><p>(m) <strong><u>U.S. Government Customers</u></strong>. The Services and Documentation are provided to the U.S. Government as “commercial items,” “commercial computer software,” “commercial computer software documentation,” and “technical data” with the same rights and restrictions generally applicable to the Services and Documentation. If Customer or any Authorized User is using Services and Documentation on behalf of the U.S. Government and these terms fail to meet the U.S. Government’s needs or are inconsistent in any respect with federal law, Customer and Customer’s Authorized Users must immediately discontinue use of the Services and Documentation. The terms listed above are defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.</p><p>(n) <strong><u>Survival</u></strong>. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the provisions of this Agreement that by their nature would survive its termination will survive indefinitely.</p><p>(o) <strong><u>Debarment, Suspension and Other Related Matters</u></strong>. Customer certifies that neither it nor its principals are presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any U.S. federal, state, or local governmental department or agency.</p><p>(p) <strong><u>Compliance with Laws</u></strong>. The parties agree to comply with all applicable national, state, and local laws, orders, and regulations during the Term.</p><p>(q) <strong><u>Third Party Beneficiary</u></strong>. No third party beneficiary relationships are intended or created by this Agreement.</p><p>(r) <strong><u>Independent Contractors</u></strong>. Customer’s relationship to Morning Consult will be that of an independent contractor. Neither Customer and its employees nor Morning Consult and its employees are agents or legal representatives of the other party for any purpose and have no authority to act for, bind, or commit the other party. This Agreement does not establish a franchise, joint venture, partnership, or agency relationship.</p><p>(s) <strong><u>Non-Solicitation</u></strong>. During the Term and for a period of one (1) year afterwards, no Customer Party will knowingly entice, persuade, or otherwise solicit any Morning Consult employee, contractor/consultant, or other representative directly engaged with the Services contemplated under this Agreement to leave Morning Consult’s services for any reason, which restriction excludes general solicitations not directed at Morning Consult’s employees, contractors/consultants, and other representatives.</p><p>(t) <strong><u>Amendment</u></strong>. We may modify these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on this website or by sending a message to the e-mail address associated with your account. The modified terms will become effective upon posting or, if we do notify you by e-mail, as stated in the e-mail message, whichever is earlier (provided, however, that such modified terms shall not apply to any Order Form previously entered into between you and Morning Consult that is in effect at the time such modified terms become effective, but for the avoidance of doubt, will apply to any new Order Form(s) entered into between you and Morning Consult after such modified terms become effective). If these Terms apply to you because you have previously (i) clicked an “I Accept” button or checkbox presented with these Terms or (ii) commenced use of any of the Services (in each case, not pursuant to an Order Form), your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any modifications to these Terms shall constitute your agreement to be bound by the Terms as modified. It is your responsibility to check this website regularly for modifications to these Terms. If you choose not to accept any modifications to these Terms, your only recourse is to stop using the Services. We last modified the Terms on the date listed below:</p><p>Updated as of November 30, 2023.</p><p><strong><u>EXHIBIT A</u></strong></p><p><strong>Service Level Agreement</strong></p><p>Morning Consult will make the Products available with an uptime commitment of at least 99.5% 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (measured quarterly), except for: (i) planned downtime (of which Morning Consult shall use best efforts to give Customer at least 8 hours written notice and which Morning Consult shall schedule, to the extent practicable, between 8:00 p.m. Friday and 5:00 a.m. Monday Eastern time), and (ii) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Morning Consult’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet service provider failure or delay, acts or omissions of users, failure or malfunction of non-Morning Consult equipment, applications or systems, failure of non-Morning Consult systems to meet applicable Product technical requirements, or denial of service attack (collectively, the “<u>Uptime Commitment</u>”). Customer’s sole remedy for any breach by Morning Consult of the obligations contained herein is termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 9(b).</p><p><strong><u>EXHIBIT B</u></strong></p><p><strong>Product Support</strong></p><p>Upon Customer’s written request, Morning Consult will designate, and provide Customer with appropriate contact information for, a primary contact person (“<u>POC</u>”) for Customer to engage in connection with the provision of support services related to Product features and availability (“<u>Support</u>”).
